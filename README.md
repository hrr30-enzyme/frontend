# Catalyst Frontend

This is the repository for the client side of the Catalyst project. Catalyst is an app designed for people that need expertise in a particular subject matter. 
We utilize the ethereum blockchain in order for users to create "bounty's" on a particular question they want answered quickly. Bounty's give incentive for the community
to respond as quickly as posible.
