Strings whose length is multiple of three and every third symbol of string is reversed. We have to tell whether it is CFL or not


-body: 
Let L be some regular set in which all strings happen to have length equal to a multiple of three. Let Twist3(L) be the set of all strings in L where every three symbols are reversed. For example if

L = {aag, cttgta, ttggagagc, ...} 
then

Twist3(L) = {gaa, ttcatg, gttgagcga, ...}. 
Explain why Twist3(L) is a CFL

MATCH Query Issues after switching to MariaDB

-body:
Hello guys I was just moved to a new server running MariaDB and now it seems my fulltext searches are not working.

For example...

SELECT * FROM table WHERE Model = "CR-V";
works.

SELECT *, MATCH (Model) AGAINST ("CR-V") as score FROM table WHERE MATCH (Model) AGAINST ("CR-V") ORDER BY score DESC;
does not return anything.

This used to work perfectly fine in my old server, now it's not. Any help would be appreciated.

Self-Join with Natural Join

-body:
What is the difference between

select * from degreeprogram  NATURAL JOIN degreeprogram ;
and

select * from degreeprogram d1 NATURAL JOIN degreeprogram d2;
in oracle? I expected that they return the same result set, however, they do not. The second query does what I expect: it joins the two relations using the same named attributes and so it returns the same tuples as stored in degreeprogram. However, the first query is confusing for me: here, each tuple occurs several times in the result set-> what join condition is used here?

Thank you

Adding CSS into mPDF just creates extra blank pages

-body:
I'm currently trying to attach CSS to my mPDF files, but i'm coming across the problem that the CSS doesn't apply but it just adds new pages? It is quite confusing.

I'm first getting all the CSS content which i want to append, then I require in the mpdf classes. I'm adding the the style to sub 1 because that's where CSS is supposed to be appended, afterwards I add the HTML to the PDF.

Using PyAutoGui when game resolution is different from actual resolution

-body:
Currently I have a function in python that looks like this:

def click_button(self, image_name):
    while not pyautogui.locateOnScreen(image_name):
        print("looking for{}".format(image_name))
    x, y = pyautogui.locateCenterOnScreen(path.join("screenshots", image_name))
    pyautogui.click(x / 2, y / 2) #"problem" here
As you can see since on my system the game is run at twice the resolution of the screen, I have to half the distance where it actually should click.

This is not a very adaptable solution and I would have to hard code the resolution for each platform.

Therefore, I was wondering if there was a native solution to clicking the screen with respect to the resolution that the current program was running at.
